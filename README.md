# [The Odin Project: A Photo Tagging App](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-where-s-waldo-a-photo-tagging-app)

This goal of this project was to build a game similar to Where's Waldo.

I didn't want to simply copy an image off of Google Images and play that.

So instead of trying to find illustrated characters, I wanted people to find typeface characters (lol)

This repo is the back-end application of the game, [the front-end is here.](https://github.com/FatCatLikesBeer/waldo)
